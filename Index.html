                <p>Hello! This is my personal page, brought by the Web Technologies Curricular Unity from the course

                    <h1><a href="https://unipe.br/historia/">University Center of João Pessoa - Unipê BR</a></h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unipê is one of the best universities in the northeast region of Brazil. With almost 50 years of history(this is very much for the academic scenery in that region), the Universitary Center of João Pessoa is the most structured instituition of the Paraíba State. At the moment, I am taking the Bachelor in Computer Science Course from the Unipê. Unipê has, also, cooperation and mobility Agreements with numerous internationally recognized European Universities, like the Universidade do Porto and Universitá de Pisa(Pisa University). These agreements has given me the opportunity to do an exchange at the Faculty of Science from the Porto University(wich I Talk about a little bit more bellow) and it is being amazing! Futhermore,  I have the sure that when I comeback to João Pessoa and end my course of Bachelor in Computer Science I will have a pretty much more global experience and viewing. Thanks for the opportunity Unipê.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Universidade do Porto(Porto University) is the most internationally recognized University  of Portugal. This happens becouse of the great number of international students, powered by agreements of cooperation and exchange programs like Erasmus and Erasmus+. I am one of these internaitonal students, and I have to say it: being in Porto is incredible and I really greatful for the opportunity that the Faculty of Science from The University of Porto has given me - until now it has been an amazing experience and have even more to come!
